I have the most experience with data analysis followed by full stack web development with the .NET entity framework stack with Angular. I believe technology powers the modern world and that makes contributing to it infinitely exciting. During my freetime you can find me being a foodie around LA with friends or playing with raspberry pi's and microcontrollers in attempts to automate daily chores.",
