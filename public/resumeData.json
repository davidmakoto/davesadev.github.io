    "bio":"I like automating whatever I can and learning new technologies. I have the most experience with data analysis in C++/Python followed by full stack web development with the DOTNET entity framework stack with Angular. Over the years I'd say my greatest skill is in troubleshooting. I think technology is at the core of what powers a lot of our modern world and that makes contributing it infinitely exciting.",
